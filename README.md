### Description

I have listed some Cybersecurity Based Projects which you can do and show in your resume in Python. 

### Projects

1. SSH Login Brute Forcer - It is used for an automated password guessing attack, commonly referred to as a brute-force attack, against an SSH server. The script uses the Python pwn library, which provides tools for exploit development and low-level interactions with programs, in conjunction with paramiko, a Python implementation of the SSHv2 protocol, to attempt to log into an SSH server using a list of common credentials.
2. SHA256 Password Cracker - A simple Password Cracker used to crack any SHA256 Hash. Python's PWN module is used.
3. Web Login Form Brute Forcer - It is a simple brute force password cracking tool written in Python designed to automate the process of attempting to log in to a specified target using HTTP POST requests with a list of potential usernames and a file containing a list of potential passwords.
4. Simple SQL Injection Script - Simple script to perform Blind SQL Injection Attack. It attempts to extract hashed password information from a vulnerable web application by sending crafted SQL queries through HTTP POST requests. It is designed to test the security of web applications by automating SQL injection attacks against user-specified targets.
5. Restricted SQL Injection Script - An advanced form of the previous script as it employs a binary search technique to extract the hashed password. This function potentially offers a more efficient way to deduce the password hash compared to the linear search approach used in the extract_hash function.
